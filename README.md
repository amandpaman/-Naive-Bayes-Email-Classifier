# -Naive-Bayes-Email-Classifier
The Email Classifier utilizes the principles of Naive Bayes, a probabilistic classification technique widely used in natural language processing tasks. By analyzing the frequency of words within emails and applying Bayes' theorem, the classifier can predict whether an email is spam or not spam.
Key Features:

Custom Implementation: The classifier is built from scratch, providing a deeper understanding of the Naive Bayes algorithm and its inner workings.

Data Preprocessing: The repository includes code for preprocessing email data, including tokenization, removing stopwords, and vectorizing emails into numerical features.

Naive Bayes Algorithm: Implements both Multinomial Naive Bayes and Bernoulli Naive Bayes algorithms for text classification tasks.

Evaluation Metrics: Provides functions for evaluating the performance of the classifier using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Command Line Interface (CLI): Allows users to interact with the classifier through a command-line interface, facilitating easy testing and usage.

Example Datasets: Includes example datasets for training and testing the classifier, enabling users to quickly get started with experimentation.

By using this repository, users can gain insights into how Naive Bayes works and leverage the classifier for email classification tasks without relying on external libraries. Contributions and feedback are welcome to improve the functionality and performance of the classifier.
